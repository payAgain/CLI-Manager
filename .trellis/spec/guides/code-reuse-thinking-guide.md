# Code Reuse Thinking Guide

> **Purpose**: Stop and think before creating new code - does it already exist?

---

## The Problem

**Duplicated code is the #1 source of inconsistency bugs.**

When you copy-paste or rewrite existing logic:
- Bug fixes don't propagate
- Behavior diverges over time
- Codebase becomes harder to understand

---

## Before Writing New Code

### Step 1: Search First

```bash
# Search for similar function names
grep -r "functionName" .

# Search for similar logic
grep -r "keyword" .
```

### Step 2: Ask These Questions

| Question | If Yes... |
|----------|-----------|
| Does a similar function exist? | Use or extend it |
| Is this pattern used elsewhere? | Follow the existing pattern |
| Could this be a shared utility? | Create it in the right place |
| Am I copying code from another file? | **STOP** - extract to shared |

---

## Common Duplication Patterns

### Pattern 1: Copy-Paste Functions

**Bad**: Copying a validation function to another file

**Good**: Extract to shared utilities, import where needed

### Pattern 2: Similar Components

**Bad**: Creating a new component that's 80% similar to existing

**Good**: Extend existing component with props/variants

### Pattern 3: Repeated Constants

**Bad**: Defining the same constant in multiple files

**Good**: Single source of truth, import everywhere

---

## When to Abstract

**Abstract when**:
- Same code appears 3+ times
- Logic is complex enough to have bugs
- Multiple people might need this

**Don't abstract when**:
- Only used once
- Trivial one-liner
- Abstraction would be more complex than duplication

## File Size: A Signal, Not a Limit

> **A large file is a signal to look, not a rule to obey.** There is no hard line count.

Do **not** split a file just to hit a number. Splitting a cohesive file by line count scatters
related logic and makes it *harder* to follow. Tooling (grep + offset reads + the GitNexus symbol
graph) locates symbols fine regardless of file length — "help the AI read it" is **not** a valid
reason to split.

The real cost of a large file is **implicit coupling**, not reading effort: when 100 functions
share the same refs, closures, and effect dependencies in one module, changing one safely means
reasoning about all of them. That is exactly the "patch here, break there" risk the
[fix-triage-guide](./fix-triage-guide.md) §1 flags as a cross-boundary hazard.

### When a big file trips the signal, ask one question

**"Is this file doing several unrelated things, or one thing thoroughly?"**

| The file is… | Action |
|---|---|
| A **junk drawer** — rendering + IPC/PTY bridging + shortcuts + state sync tangled together | Consider splitting **along responsibility seams** — to decouple and reduce blast radius, not to shrink the number |
| **Cohesive** — single responsibility, clear state, rarely churns (even if long) | Leave it. Splitting wastes effort and hurts readability |

### If you do split

- Split by **responsibility boundary**, never by line count.
- Don't create a `utils.ts` junk drawer — that hides coupling instead of removing it.
- This is a refactor: run `gitnexus_impact` first, and it needs its own task/approval — don't fold it into an unrelated change.

## After Batch Modifications

When you've made similar changes to multiple files:

1. **Review**: Did you catch all instances?
2. **Search**: Run grep to find any missed
3. **Consider**: Should this be abstracted?

---

## Gotcha: Asymmetric Mechanisms Producing Same Output

**Problem**: When two different mechanisms must produce the same file set (e.g., recursive directory copy for init vs. manual `files.set()` for update), structural changes (renaming, moving, adding subdirectories) only propagate through the automatic mechanism. The manual one silently drifts.

**Symptom**: Init works perfectly, but update creates files at wrong paths or misses files entirely.

**Prevention checklist**:
- [ ] When migrating directory structures, search for ALL code paths that reference the old structure
- [ ] If one path is auto-derived (glob/copy) and another is manually listed, the manual one needs updating
- [ ] Add a regression test that compares outputs from both mechanisms

---

## Checklist Before Commit

- [ ] Searched for existing similar code
- [ ] No copy-pasted logic that should be shared
- [ ] Constants defined in one place
- [ ] Similar patterns follow same structure
