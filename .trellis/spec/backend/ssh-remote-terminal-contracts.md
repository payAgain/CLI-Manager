# SSH Remote Terminal Contracts

## 1. Scope / Trigger

Apply this contract when changing SSH host persistence, remote project creation, remote directory queries, terminal launch, PTY/daemon restore, project capability routing, or project sync/import behavior.

SSH projects support remote terminals plus explicit Claude/Codex Agent Hook integration, read-only history, and same-source remote resume. Local and WSL projects retain their existing capabilities. Remote files, Git, Worktree, historical statistics, provider switching, external terminal launch, and remote resource monitoring remain separate implementations.

## 2. Signatures

pub async fn ssh_test_connection(spec: SshConnectionSpec, accept_new_host_key: Option<bool>)
    -> Result<SshConnectionTestResult, String>;
pub async fn ssh_save_password(host_id: String, password: String)

```

### Terminal launch

```rust
pub struct SshLaunchPlan {
    pub host_id: String,
    pub host: String,
    pub port: u16,
    pub username: String,
    pub config_alias: String,
    pub config_file: String,
    pub auth_mode: String,
    pub identity_file: String,
    pub jump_target: String,
    pub proxy_command: String,

    pub server_alive_count_max: u32,
    pub remote_path: String,
    pub client_instance_id: String,
    pub project_id: String,
    pub project_name: String,
    pub bridge_epoch: String,
    pub agent_path: String,
    pub agent_installation_id: String,

    pub tool_source: String,
    pub environment_overrides: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub initialization_command: Option<String>,
    pub startup_command: Option<String>,
}
```

`pty_create` and the daemon `ClientFrame::Create` accept an optional structured `ssh_launch`. The frontend resolves the plan but must not build a complete shell-escaped `ssh` command string.

## 3. Contracts

### Host and project identity

- A host is a reusable machine-local connection asset; a project is a user-visible workspace binding one host to one POSIX remote directory.
- SSH project identity is `(environment_type = "ssh", ssh_host_id, normalized remote_path)`. Never use the local `path` field to identify an SSH project.
- Deleting a host sets project `ssh_host_id` to `null`; the project remains visible and must require explicit rebinding before launch.
- Host grouping is independent from the existing manual project grouping.
- `ssh_host_groups` owns the editable multi-level SSH host tree. `ssh_hosts.group_name` is legacy display/migration data; new UI should bind by `group_id`.
- Migration 21 must preserve old flat `group_name` values as root groups and backfill each host's `group_id`.
- Migration 22 adds `ssh_hosts.config_file TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''`; empty values keep the system OpenSSH default config behavior.

### Authentication and secrets

- Supported launch modes are `ssh_config`, `agent`, `identity_file`, `credential_ref`, `password_prompt`, and `interactive`.
- `credential_ref` means Username / Password: SQLite stores only the credential reference, while the secret lives in the platform credential store.
- Saved SSH passwords must use the shared credential store: Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, or Linux Secret Service. Native WSL support depends on Secret Service availability.
- OpenSSH receives saved passwords only through the one-shot loopback AskPass helper. The command line, ordinary logs, WebDAV payloads, exports, session snapshots, and normal environment data must not contain the password.
- Passwords, private-key contents/passphrases, and proxy credentials must not enter SQLite, Tauri store, session snapshots, logs, WebDAV, or local exports.
- `identity_file` is machine-local and must not be synchronized.
- `config_file` is machine-local and must not be synchronized, exported, or written to ordinary logs.
- Host key trust and changed-key blocking remain owned by system OpenSSH.

### SSH Config import

- Native Windows, Linux, and macOS use the current user's `~/.ssh` as the default import directory. WSL config discovery is intentionally unsupported.
- The import UI may select another directory, but Rust must validate the absolute directory, canonicalize its `config` file, and return stable localized error codes for missing, unreadable, oversized, or invalid UTF-8 input.
- Discovery imports concrete `Host` aliases only. It supports BOM, CRLF/LF, multiple aliases, recursive `Include`, `~`, environment variables, relative paths, glob expansion, deterministic ordering, depth/file limits, and cycle detection.
- Wildcard or negated Host patterns are not candidates. Includes inside conditional `Host` or `Match` blocks are skipped with a warning; preview must not run `ssh -G` or establish a network connection.
- Existing aliases are compared case-insensitively and never overwritten. Selected aliases are inserted in one SQLite transaction and any failure rolls the entire batch back.
- Completion feedback reports successful, failed, and duplicate-skipped counts. A committed transaction reports zero failures; a rolled-back transaction reports zero successes and all attempted aliases as failed.
- Imports from the default directory store an empty `config_file`. Imports from a custom directory store the canonical absolute `config` path.

### Remote paths and commands

- Remote project paths are absolute POSIX paths.
- The remote directory picker treats an empty or whitespace-only browse path as `/` before invoking Rust; backend validation remains strict for non-empty relative or traversal paths, and the UI localizes those validation errors.
- Reject NUL, CR, LF, relative paths, and any `..` path segment at the Rust boundary.
- Quote every path and environment value with the dedicated POSIX quoting helper.
- Environment keys must match shell variable syntax.
- Directory browsing/check commands use non-interactive `BatchMode=yes` for SSH Config, Agent, and identity-file modes.
- Every OpenSSH probe, directory query, and terminal launch must add `-F <config_file>` when `config_file` is non-empty. If that file later becomes invalid or unreadable, return an error and never fall back to the default config.
- HTTP and SOCKS5 proxy URLs are stored as structured `proxy_type`, `proxy_host`, and `proxy_port` fields. The app binary provides the stdio proxy helper used by OpenSSH `ProxyCommand`; users must not need to author a raw command.
- When a direct HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy is enabled, it takes precedence over `ProxyJump`; do not emit both routes for the same connection.
- Connection testing must probe a configured HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy as a separate diagnostic stage before starting SSH, and return the sanitized proxy endpoint plus the raw connect/handshake error when that stage fails.
- Connection testing must run OpenSSH in verbose mode and complete as soon as stderr reports `Authenticated to ...`; it must not wait for a remote command or shell session to exit after authentication succeeds.
- Username/password testing may try `password` and `keyboard-interactive`, with at most one password prompt, so servers that expose password login through keyboard-interactive are covered without repeated prompts.
- Username/password terminal launches must allow both `password` and `keyboard-interactive`; the launch path must not use stricter authentication methods than the successful connection-test path.
- The `__ssh_proxy` helper subcommand must be dispatched before inherited AskPass environment handling; password-authenticated SSH processes pass AskPass variables to ProxyCommand children.
- The proxy stdio bridge must flush every remote-to-OpenSSH chunk immediately. SSH handshake packets are binary and may be smaller than the Windows stdout buffer; waiting for EOF to flush can deadlock key exchange at `expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS`.
- `credential_ref` directory browsing/check commands use `BatchMode=no` plus AskPass. Any AskPass/credential error must be returned; do not silently retry without the password.
- `password_prompt` and `interactive` modes require a real PTY and must return `ssh_interactive_auth_required` for directory browsing/check commands.
- A successful launch enters `remote_path`, emits OSC 777 `cli-manager-ssh=connected`, applies environment overrides, runs initialization/startup commands, and finally returns to the user's remote login shell.
- Remote history resume uses the Agent-verified original cwd. A no-project resume may pass that cwd as the structured SSH `remote_path`; it never becomes a desktop-local cwd.
- Claude/Codex tool config roots use this priority: SSH project `cli_config_root`, matching `ssh_host_tool_preferences`, then the CLI native default. Native default means no environment variable is injected.
- Resolve the source only from the SSH project's configured `cli_tool`. Inject `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` for Claude or `CODEX_HOME` for Codex; do not scan or switch remote providers.
- Absolute POSIX roots use normal POSIX quoting. `~` and `~/...` roots must be rendered with an explicit quoted `${HOME}` prefix so shell expansion occurs without evaluating arbitrary variables or command substitution.
- Active PTYs capture the root in their launch plan. Editing a Host or project root affects only subsequent launches and never rewrites a running session.
- Opening an SSH project without an explicit session command resolves its project command as `startup_cmd` first, otherwise `cli_tool + cli_args`; project environment variables follow the same fallback rule. The in-terminal `New Terminal` actions explicitly request an empty command so they open a shell in the same remote directory instead of relaunching the project's CLI. Explicit resume/template commands take precedence, and machine-local provider overrides are not injected into the remote command.
- SSH startup commands are embedded in `SshLaunchPlan` and executed exactly once by the remote launch command. The frontend may retain the resolved command as session metadata but must not write it again through `pty_write`.
- A configured initialization/startup command runs inside one login shell, then hands control to a non-login interactive shell that inherits the initialized environment. Do not start a second login shell after the command; repeated MOTD/profile output can bury command output and rerun login side effects.

### PTY, daemon, and restore

- The local OpenSSH process is the PTY root process; xterm rendering remains unchanged.
- Persist `environmentType`, `sshHostId`, `remotePath`, `connectionState`, and `disconnectReason` in terminal session snapshots.
- Reopen a live daemon session by attaching to its existing PTY. Never rerun the SSH launch or startup command.
- An exited daemon session may restore replay and disconnected metadata only.
- If an older daemon rejects the SSH create frame, fall back to the in-process PTY path; legacy local Create frames remain compatible.
- Rust removes user-supplied reserved Hook variables and injects `CLI_MANAGER_SSH_HOST_ID`, `CLI_MANAGER_SSH_CLIENT_INSTANCE_ID`, `CLI_MANAGER_PROJECT_ID`, `CLI_MANAGER_TAB_ID`, and `CLI_MANAGER_BRIDGE_EPOCH` from validated launch/session state. `project_name` is desktop-only display metadata and must not be exported to the remote environment.
- The daemon stores the corresponding Hook binding, including the configured sidebar project name, with the live PTY. Remote events are accepted only when Host/client/project/Tab/epoch/Agent installation/source all match and the session remains alive; only then may the daemon attach the trusted project display name for third-party notification rendering.
- One daemon Agent bridge is reused for active sessions on the same Host/client/connection identity. PTYs remain independent SSH processes. The last Host session release stops the Hook bridge; probe/install/config operations remain short-lived connections.
- Remote resume persists `cliSessionId`, history source instance, and history consumer identity with the terminal. The same current-client session jumps to its existing Tab; another consumer is blocked until PTY exit/error/close releases ownership.

### Capability routing

- All SSH feature entry points must consult `resolveProjectCapabilities` or an equivalent hard backend/store guard.
- SSH project capabilities allow `terminal`, `splitTerminal`, `commandTemplates`, remote `files`, read-only remote `git`, remote `history`, and remote `statistics`; remote Hook state is routed by the dedicated Agent/binding contract rather than by local history/provider capability fallbacks.
- Switching to an SSH session must not close a supported terminal side panel. Files, Git, history/replay, and statistics remain open after their asynchronous remote load completes in both merged and independent panel layouts.
- Opening session history from an SSH terminal scopes both remote synchronization and cached listing to that project's `remote_path`; the empty desktop-local `path` must never be passed as the history filter or interpreted as all remote projects.
- A hidden or disabled UI control is not sufficient for files and Worktree: stores must reject SSH projects before invoking local filesystem/Git processes.
- `findProjectByPath` and other local path matchers must exclude SSH projects and empty local paths.
- The system resources panel is local-only and must be labelled `Local Resources` / `本机资源` for SSH sessions.
- SSH provider fields stay null/ignored in the launch plan. Hook inspect/install never reads cc-switch or discovers remote provider data.

### Sync

- Sync/export may carry project `environment_type`, `remote_path`, and `cli_config_root`.
- It must exclude `ssh_hosts`, `ssh_host_id`, `config_file`, `identity_file`, `credential_ref`, passwords, and machine-specific proxy credentials.
- Imported SSH projects have `ssh_host_id = null`, preserve only a valid explicit POSIX/`~/...` project config root, and clear machine-specific provider/worktree configuration before requesting host rebinding.

## 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required result |
|---|---|

| Agent installation or remote machine identity changed | refuse Hook config/bridge with `ssh_agent_identity_changed` |

## 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: one host profile backs several SSH projects with distinct remote paths and existing manual project groups.
- Good: a path such as `/srv/project name/开发` is quoted once, opens correctly, and cannot inject shell syntax.
- Good: application restart attaches a daemon-owned SSH PTY without repeating initialization commands.
- Good: Username / Password host can test connection and browse/check a remote path through AskPass without exposing the password.
- Good: project `~/state/claude` overrides the Host Claude root and launches with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="${HOME}"/'state/claude'`.
- Good: two projects on one Host use independent Tab/epoch bindings while sharing one client/Host Hook bridge; events route only to the originating live Tab.
- Base: no project or Host root exists, so Claude/Codex uses its native default without an injected variable.
- Base: Hook is not installed; the SSH terminal still runs normally and only live Hook status is unavailable.
- Good: a host imported from a custom config directory uses the same canonical `config_file` for testing, browsing, and terminal launch.
- Base: password-prompt/MFA users manually enter a remote path, then authenticate in the real PTY.
- Base: a host imported from the default `~/.ssh/config` stores an empty `config_file` and lets OpenSSH resolve its normal user config.
- Base: an imported SSH project remains visible with a rebinding warning.
- Bad: treating `path = ""` as a local project key; on POSIX this can match every local path.
- Bad: passing a remote POSIX path into local filesystem, Git, Worktree, history, or provider APIs.
- Bad: falling back to default OpenSSH config after a custom `config_file` is moved or becomes unreadable.
- Bad: synchronizing host IDs or private-key paths across machines.
- Bad: quoting `~/.claude` as one literal shell token; this disables tilde expansion and points the CLI at a directory named `~`.

## 6. Tests Required

- Run `npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Run `cargo check` and `cargo test --lib` from `src-tauri`.
- Assert migration defaults all existing projects to `local` and host deletion nulls remote bindings.
- Assert SSH group migration preserves legacy flat groups as root `ssh_host_groups` and backfills `ssh_hosts.group_id`.
- Assert migration 22 gives existing SSH hosts an empty `config_file`.
- Assert SSH Config discovery handles BOM/CRLF, concrete and wildcard aliases, recursive/glob/conditional Includes, cycles, limits, and Windows path separators.
- Assert custom `config_file` reaches connection probes and terminal launches through `-F`, missing files fail, and legacy daemon frames deserialize with an empty default.
- Assert launch-plan validation, POSIX quoting, environment-key validation, proxy credential rejection, jump targets, and legacy daemon frame compatibility.
- Assert password/interactive/agent modes do not include stale identity-file arguments after auth-mode switches.
- Assert AskPass serves a saved password only for the matching one-shot token and rejects reused or unknown prompts.
- Assert remote path checking accepts spaces/Unicode/single quotes and rejects traversal, relative paths, NUL, CR, and LF.
- Assert project root overrides Host root, Host root overrides native default, and unrelated/local/WSL launches receive no SSH tool-root injection.
- Assert absolute, `~`, and `~/...` config roots render safely; reject traversal, relative paths, expansion syntax, backslashes, NUL, CR, and LF at the Rust boundary.
- Assert deleting a Host cascades Host preferences while retaining validated integration identity with `host_id = NULL` and `unbound/retained` state.
- Assert Rust overwrites reserved binding env, provider launch fields remain null for SSH, one Host bridge serves multiple PTYs, mismatched events are rejected, and the final PTY release stops the bridge.
- Assert session restore attaches live daemon PTYs and never reruns an exited SSH command.
- Assert SSH projects are rejected by file and Worktree stores and excluded from local path matching.
- Assert export/import omits all host and credential fields and requires rebinding.
- Manually verify OpenSSH Agent, private key, password/MFA, first host key, changed host key, ProxyJump, ProxyCommand, network interruption, zh-CN/en-US, and 24-hour time display.

## 7. Wrong vs Correct

### Wrong: build SSH in the WebView

```ts
const command = `ssh ${user}@${host} "cd ${remotePath} && ${startupCommand}"`;
invoke("pty_create", { shell: command });
```

This mixes UI data with shell syntax, bypasses Rust validation, and makes daemon restore inconsistent.

### Correct: pass a structured launch plan

```ts
invoke("pty_create", {
  sshLaunch: {
    hostId,
    host,
    port,
    username,
    remotePath,
    environmentOverrides,
    startupCommand,
  },
});
```

Rust validates the plan, builds OpenSSH arguments, quotes remote shell values, and uses the same representation for in-process PTY and daemon execution.

### Wrong: rely only on disabled UI

```ts
if (remote) return <DisabledGitButton />;
```

### Correct: route and enforce capabilities at both boundaries

```ts
if (!projectSupportsCapability(project, "git")) return null;
```

The corresponding store/backend path must also reject SSH projects before any local path operation.

### Wrong: quote a tilde root literally

```rust
format!("export CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR={}", posix_quote("~/.claude"))
```

### Correct: expand only the supported HOME shorthand

```rust
format!("export CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=\"${{HOME}}\"/{}", posix_quote(".claude"))
```

The dedicated validator rejects all other shell expansion syntax before command construction.

### Wrong: copy expanded SSH options into app fields

```ts
createHost({ host: resolvedHostName, username: resolvedUser, identity_file: resolvedKey });
```

This freezes machine-specific OpenSSH resolution, risks persisting private configuration, and diverges from future config changes.

### Correct: preserve the OpenSSH reference

```ts
createHost({
  name: alias,
  config_alias: alias,
  config_file: isDefaultDirectory ? "" : canonicalConfigFile,
  auth_mode: "ssh_config",
});
```

Rust then validates the path and adds `-F <config_file>` consistently for every OpenSSH process.
