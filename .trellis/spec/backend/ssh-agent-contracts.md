# SSH Agent Contracts

## 1. Scope / Trigger

Apply this contract when changing `cli-manager-ssh-agent`, shared SSH transport generation, one-shot Agent probes, Agent installation metadata, bridge framing, or the SSH Host CLI Integration status UI.

The current delivered scope is the standalone Agent protocol skeleton, explicit one-shot `version/status/doctor` probing, and the signed Agent install/upgrade/rollback/uninstall supply chain. Agent lifecycle availability does not imply that Hook, history, files, Git, stats, or a persistent bridge is already delivered.

## 2. Signatures

### Shared transport

```rust
pub struct SshTransportSpec {
    pub host: String,
    pub port: u16,
    pub username: String,
    pub config_alias: String,
    pub auth_mode: String,
    pub identity_file: String,
    pub credential_ref: String,
    pub jump_target: String,
    pub proxy_type: String,
    pub proxy_host: String,
    pub proxy_port: u16,
    pub proxy_command: String,
    pub connect_timeout_sec: u64,
    pub server_alive_interval_sec: u64,
    pub server_alive_count_max: u32,
}

pub fn build_interactive_launch(remote_command: String) -> Result<SshTransportLaunch, String>;
pub fn build_one_shot_launch(
    remote_command: String,
    options: SshOneShotOptions,
) -> Result<SshTransportLaunch, String>;
```

### Tauri command

```rust
pub async fn ssh_agent_probe(
    host_id: String,
    spec: SshTransportSpec,
    agent_path: Option<String>,
) -> Result<SshAgentProbeResult, String>;

pub async fn ssh_agent_install_preview(...) -> Result<SshAgentInstallPreview, String>;
pub async fn ssh_agent_install(...) -> Result<SshAgentOperationResult, String>;
pub async fn ssh_agent_rollback(...) -> Result<SshAgentOperationResult, String>;
pub async fn ssh_agent_uninstall(...) -> Result<SshAgentOperationResult, String>;
```

`SshAgentProbeResult` contains `status`, stable `code`, sanitized executable/version/protocol/target metadata, `supported`, and an ephemeral diagnostic `detail`. Only metadata fields enter `ssh_agent_installations`; `detail` is never persisted.

### Agent CLI and bridge

```text
cli-manager-ssh-agent version
cli-manager-ssh-agent status
cli-manager-ssh-agent doctor
cli-manager-ssh-agent install [--install-dir PATH] [--allow-downgrade]
cli-manager-ssh-agent rollback [--install-dir PATH]
cli-manager-ssh-agent uninstall [--install-dir PATH] [--purge]
cli-manager-ssh-agent bridge --stdio --protocol 1
```

Bridge output begins with:

```text
CLI_MANAGER_SSH_AGENT/1 <nonce>\n
```

Frames use a four-byte big-endian length followed by UTF-8 JSON. The maximum frame size is 1 MiB.

## 3. Contracts

- Interactive PTY and one-shot execution must share authentication, port, config alias, timeout, KeepAlive, identity, AskPass, ProxyJump, and ProxyCommand generation.
- Interactive launches use `ssh -tt`; one-shot probe/install/doctor launches use `ssh -T`, `ConnectionAttempts=1`, and `BatchMode=yes`, except saved credential mode uses one-shot AskPass with `BatchMode=no` and one password prompt.
- Saving or opening SSH Host settings never probes automatically. Only the explicit Probe Agent action creates the one-shot SSH process.
- Password-prompt and multi-round interactive authentication return `authenticationRequired`; background retries must stop.
- Probe discovery accepts a previously persisted explicit path, `PATH`, `$HOME/.local/bin/cli-manager-ssh-agent`, or the standard XDG data `current` path. Explicit paths accept only absolute POSIX or `~/...` syntax.
- Probe stdout may contain at most 8 KiB of login banner before `CLI_MANAGER_SSH_AGENT_PROBE/1`. Total retained stdout is 64 KiB and stderr is 8 KiB; readers continue draining excess bytes without growing retained memory.
- After the probe marker, stdout is strict: state line, absolute executable path, then exactly one doctor JSON document. Extra text, invalid UTF-8, unsafe paths, oversized output, or malformed identity is rejected.
- Protocol major mismatch is incompatible. Protocol minor differences are handled later through capabilities. The first supported Agent target matrix is Linux `x86_64` and `aarch64`.
- `ssh_agent_installations` preserves last-known sanitized metadata on unreachable/authentication-required probes, but a confirmed `notInstalled` result clears stale version/path metadata.
- Bridge `--protocol` is mandatory. A clean EOF before a frame starts is normal; a partial four-byte length or payload is a protocol error.
- Desktop install and the HTTP(S) script consume the same schema-1 release manifest and Tauri updater Minisign trust root. The signature covers manifest bytes; the manifest pins channel, semantic version, protocol range, Linux target, URL, size, and SHA-256.
- Release URLs default to HTTPS. HTTP requires explicit user opt-in, never permits embedded credentials, query strings, or fragments, and still requires a valid signature. Manifest, signature, and artifact downloads are bounded.
- Install preview is read-only. Confirmation re-fetches and re-verifies the manifest before downloading or opening SSH, preventing a stale preview from authorizing different bytes.
- The desktop uploads the verified artifact through `ssh -T` stdin to a random state-directory staging path. The remote shell receives only fixed commands plus POSIX-quoted validated values; the WebView never assembles an unrestricted shell program.
- The Agent owns installation transactions: an exclusive lock, `versions/<version>`, atomic `current`/`previous` symlinks, a CLI-Manager-owned `$HOME/.local/bin` launcher, and an atomic XDG state `installation.json` discovery record.
- Existing custom install roots are reused from the discovery record when no new root is supplied. A corrupt record is archived and repaired by an explicit install. A valid current binary remains the downgrade authority even if the record is missing.
- Downgrades are rejected unless explicitly allowed. A failed promote restores `current`, `previous`, and the launcher. Rollback swaps only distinct valid versions and restores links if self-check or record persistence fails.
- Uninstall quarantines managed versions before removing links and the discovery record; a failure restores all original links and versions. Normal uninstall keeps one bounded record, while `--purge` removes Agent state. No Agent lifecycle command modifies Claude/Codex Hook configuration.
- Operation JSON is accepted only after strict marker, action, UUID, version, protocol, target, path, source, manifest URL, and SHA-256 validation. Arbitrary remote output is never persisted.

## 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: four PTYs on one Host retain independent interactive SSH processes while an explicit Agent probe uses one short-lived `ssh -T` process.
- Good: a login banner precedes the marker by less than 8 KiB; the doctor report is parsed and only sanitized metadata is stored.
- Base: the Agent is absent; the UI records `notInstalled` without installing anything or modifying Hook configuration.
- Base: MFA authentication requires an interactive terminal; the probe reports `authenticationRequired` and does not retry.
- Good: a signed x64/aarch64 artifact is uploaded through stdin, self-checks from staging, atomically becomes `current`, and leaves the former version as `previous`.
- Good: an existing custom install root is upgraded in place without needing to repeat `--install-dir` inside the Agent transaction.
- Base: a missing or malformed discovery record is reconstructed only after an explicit install; no page-open or probe action changes remote files.
- Bad: trust an artifact hash from the WebView, skip manifest re-verification after preview, overwrite a non-owned launcher, or run `curl | sh` without review.
- Bad: reuse the `-tt` terminal launch to run doctor, causing PTY/profile output to contaminate protocol stdout.
- Bad: cache remote stderr, proxy credentials, AskPass tokens, or arbitrary doctor JSON in SQLite.
- Bad: treat partial frame headers as clean disconnects; this hides protocol truncation and corrupt streams.

## 6. Tests Required

- Run `npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Run `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` with no warnings.
- Run `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --lib`.
- Run `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/ssh-agent/Cargo.toml`.
- Assert transport parity for config alias, Agent, identity-file, credential reference, interactive auth, ProxyJump, and direct proxy precedence.
- Assert explicit path validation and safe HOME expansion.
- Assert bounded banner/report parsing, invalid UTF-8/contamination, protocol mismatch, identity mismatch, unsupported target, clean EOF, partial frame length, oversized frame, and mandatory bridge protocol.
- Assert manifest tampering, duplicate/unknown targets, HTTP opt-in, query/fragment rejection, target selection, size/SHA-256 mismatch, and bounded downloads.
- Assert install path quoting, strict operation markers/metadata, semantic version actions, lock conflicts, default/custom roots, corrupt/missing discovery recovery, promote rollback, distinct previous versions, and transactional uninstall.
- Run the POSIX installer smoke test for HTTPS dry-run, default HTTP rejection, explicit HTTP, custom install root, downgrade forwarding, and temporary-directory cleanup.
- Compile the Agent for Linux `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` in addition to host tests.
- Manually verify the CLI Integration page opens without SSH traffic and only Probe Agent starts a one-shot connection.

## 7. Wrong vs Correct

### Wrong: reuse the terminal PTY launch

```rust
ssh_launch.build_process_launch(); // emits -tt and enters the project shell
```

### Correct: share transport settings, select the correct launch mode

```rust
transport.build_interactive_launch(project_command);
transport.build_one_shot_launch(agent_probe_script, SshOneShotOptions::default());
```

The shared transport owns authentication and routing; the caller owns whether the process is an interactive PTY or a bounded one-shot operation.
