## 💡 Overview

CLI-Manager is a desktop app focused on **AI CLI workflow enhancement**. It combines local and SSH terminals, multi-project management, deep Claude Code / Codex integration, multi-source history, Git Worktree isolation, and mobile-assisted conversations.

> **Platform support**: Windows (fully tested) | macOS / Linux (experimental, feedback welcome)

### 🎯 Why CLI-Manager?

When developing across multiple projects, you may run into these problems:

- ❌ You must keep watching the terminal while Claude / Codex runs, and one missed approval request can block the task
- ❌ You want to review what code changed in a previous session, but Claude history has no Diff view
- ❌ You do not know how many tokens you used this month or which project costs the most
- ❌ You switch terminals across many projects and repeatedly type the same commands
- ❌ You want different Claude backends for different projects (official / proxy / self-hosted), but have to edit environment variables manually

**CLI-Manager provides:**

✅ **Real-time hook notifications** - desktop alerts when Claude needs approval, click to jump back<br>
✅ **Live session statistics** - token usage, cost, and tool calls for each terminal session<br>
✅ **Historical Diff review** - review code changes across sessions and jump back to the triggering message<br>
✅ **Usage analytics dashboard** - heatmaps, trends, efficiency scatter charts, and more<br>
✅ **SSH remote development** - launch and manage remote AI CLI terminals without leaving the workspace<br>
✅ **cc-connect phone conversations** - continue Claude Code / Codex sessions from Telegram or Feishu<br>
✅ **Multi-source session history** - parse and search histories from 11 AI CLI / coding-agent sources<br>
✅ **Mature Worktree isolation** - isolate, commit, merge, and clean up parallel tasks through a guided workflow<br>
✅ **Durable background tasks** - keep terminal jobs running and attach again after reopening the app<br>
✅ **Desktop pets** - visualize session status and jump back to active tasks from a floating companion<br>
✅ **Project-level provider switching** - switch Claude backend per project without editing config manually<br>
✅ **Flexible split layout** - free terminal splits plus tab dragging across panes<br>
✅ **Command palette and templates** - launch projects or run common commands quickly with `Ctrl+P`

### 📱 Mobile Conversations with cc-connect

- **Chat from your phone** - use Telegram or Feishu to start independent Claude Code / Codex conversations on the desktop host
- **Project-scoped access** - explicitly select the project exposed to remote conversations and restrict access with a fail-closed user-ID allowlist
- **Managed runtime** - CLI-Manager verifies the supported cc-connect binary checksum, generates an isolated configuration, supervises the process, and can start it with the app
- **Secure credentials** - bot tokens and app secrets are stored in Windows Credential Manager instead of generated config files
- **Claude and Codex support** - Claude uses its permission modes; Codex uses the app-server stdio approval channel, with YOLO mode available only through an explicit warning and confirmation
- **History convergence** - remote conversations create native CLI histories and flow back into CLI-Manager's unified session workspace

> The current cc-connect integration runs on a Windows desktop host and supervises one project plus one messaging platform at a time. Telegram and Feishu are supported.

## 🤖 Agent Parallelism

CLI-Manager provides two mature parallel-work paths: automatic sub-agent visualization inside the terminal workspace, and project-level Git Worktree isolation for independent tasks.

### 🤖 Automatic Sub-agent Splitting

- **Smart splits** - automatically creates split terminals when Claude Code dispatches sub-agents
- **Session association** - each sub-agent gets an independent terminal with live status sync
- **Layout optimization** - automatically adjusts split layout based on agent count

### 🌿 Mature Git Worktree Task Isolation

- **Flexible isolation strategies** - keep normal opening as the default, prompt when a parallel CLI task exists, auto-isolate parallel sessions, or always create a Worktree
- **Dedicated directory and branch** - each task uses an independent Worktree directory and `wt/<task-name>` branch
- **Integrated project context** - file browsing, Git status, history, live statistics, provider overrides, and terminal focus follow the active Worktree
- **Dependency setup** - optionally detect missing dependencies and open a dedicated installation terminal
- **Finish-task wizard** - review and commit changes, merge into the main workspace, abort safely on conflicts, and clean up the Worktree / branch
- **Safety guards** - block merges into a dirty main workspace, skip no-diff merges, handle stale / damaged Worktrees, and retry cleanup around Windows file locks

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Download a Release

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/dark-hxx/CLI-Manager/releases) page and download the latest version.

> Windows builds are the primary release artifact at the moment. macOS / Linux users are recommended to build from source.

### SSH Remote Agent

For a configured SSH Host, open **Settings -> SSH Hosts -> CLI Integration** to explicitly preview and install, upgrade, roll back, or uninstall `cli-manager-ssh-agent`. The first supported remote targets are Linux x86_64 and aarch64. Opening the page never connects automatically, and Agent lifecycle operations never install or modify Claude/Codex Hooks.

The same signed release artifacts can be installed from a reviewed POSIX script:

```sh
curl -fL -o install-ssh-agent.sh https://github.com/dark-hxx/CLI-Manager/releases/latest/download/install-ssh-agent.sh
less install-ssh-agent.sh
sh install-ssh-agent.sh
```

The script requires `curl`, `minisign`, and either `jq` or `python3`. It verifies the signed manifest, target, artifact size, and SHA-256 before execution. Use `--install-dir` for a custom root; HTTP mirrors require the explicit `--allow-http` option and still must pass the built-in public-key verification.

### Option 2: Run from Source

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- Rust >= 1.70
- Operating system: Windows 10/11 | macOS | Linux

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### Start Development Mode

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

#### Build a Release

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

#### Other Useful Commands

```bash
# TypeScript type check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Rust check
cd src-tauri && cargo check

# Rust tests
cd src-tauri && cargo test
```
